## Environment Variables Handling

In this project, environment variables are loaded and validated using Bun's native capabilities instead of NestJSâ€™s ConfigModule. This decision was made to keep the setup simpler and more straightforward.
Why Bun for Environment Variables?

- **Automatic env file selection**: When NODE_ENV is set to production, Bun automatically loads environment variables from .env.production instead of .env or .env.development. This prevents accidentally running the API with development settings in a production environment.
- **Synchronous loading and validation**: Bun loads and validates environment variables synchronously at startup, simplifying configuration management without asynchronous complexities seen in some NestJS modules.
- **Avoids DI complexity**: By using Bun directly, we bypass dependency injection issues related to asynchronous config loading in NestJS (e.g., with forRootAsync).

This approach results in a clean, reliable configuration setup with strong type safety and environment-specific loading behavior, making it easier to manage multiple environments securely and effectively.
